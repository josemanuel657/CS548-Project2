    "# Data Preprocessing\n",
    "In this project, the objective of the data preprocessing phase was to gather and clean relevant data from multiple sources to prepare it for match outcome prediction. The data spans various levels, including team, competition, match, and player-level data. The primary steps involved in this process were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Integration**: \n",
    "   I began by loading multiple datasets such as player appearances, valuations, and game lineups, ensuring that all necessary information related to players and teams was available. I merged these datasets, creating a unified structure that included key data points like player positions, market value, and club associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**: \n",
    "   Missing values were handled by filling gaps in important columns, such as player positions and manager names, with either defaults or medians for numeric data. I also dealt with duplicate and unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset. Additionally, string-based monetary values were converted into numerical format for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: \n",
    "   To enhance the predictive power of the data, I generated new features, such as per-minute statistics for goals, assists, yellow and red cards, and calculated the standard deviation and mean for each player's performance across matches. This allowed me to capture both the consistency and overall contribution of players during the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Transformation**: \n",
    "   Position data was mapped to broader categories (e.g., Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, Attackers) to simplify analysis. Extreme values were capped to minimize the impact of outliers on the model. I also created a performance score based on goals, assists, and cards, weighted according to their importance for the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Team and Competition Data**: \n",
    "   Club-level data (such as average age, transfer records, and market values) and competition details were merged into the main dataset, providing team-level insights that could influence match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Match Outcome Labeling**: \n",
    "   Finally, I created a column representing match outcomes (win, lose, tie) based on the goals scored by home and away teams. This label serves as the target variable for the match prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these steps, the dataset was thoroughly cleaned and enriched, ensuring that both team-level and player-level data were aligned for accurate match outcome prediction.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "## Player Data Integration and Preparation for Match Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in obtaining relevant player information focused on gathering key data necessary for predicting match outcomes. I loaded and merged player appearances, details, and valuations, ensuring I had the most recent player stats and positions. By filtering for the 2023 season and incorporating attributes like current club and league, I built a dataset that combines individual player performance with team dynamics. This data processing is crucial for match prediction, as player contributions (goals, assists, cards, etc.) directly impact team performance, which in turn influences match outcomes."

    "1. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**:\n",
    "   I removed irrelevant columns such as coach names and club IDs that were either duplicated or not useful for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "   I filled missing values for key columns like player positions, manager names, and stadiums with default values like 'Unknown'. For numerical columns like attendance and team average age, I used the median value to fill gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Converting Monetary Values**:\n",
    "   I converted transfer record data from strings (e.g., \"€1.5m\") to numerical values to standardize the dataset and filled any missing transfer records with the median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Missing Player and Competition Data**:\n",
    "   Missing values in numeric player-related columns were filled with the mean, while non-numeric and competition-related columns were filled with defaults such as 'Unknown' or 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating Match Outcome Labels**:\n",
    "   I defined the match outcome (win, lose, or tie) based on the number of goals scored by the home and away teams. This serves as the target variable for the prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Validation**:\n",
    "   After processing, I validated the data by checking for any remaining missing values to ensure completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Saving the Cleaned Data**:\n",
    "   Finally, I saved the cleaned dataframe for further analysis and model training, confirming that the match outcome and other key features were correctly processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures the dataset is well-prepared for accurate match outcome predictions."
